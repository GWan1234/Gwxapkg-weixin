## 🎯 Sensitive Information Scanning

### Scanning Rules (920 Built-in Rules)

920 built-in rules are enabled by default. Although many of the newly added rules still use names like `xxx secret`, the program no longer classifies them purely by literal names. Instead, it prioritizes service domain and usage so the report stays organized instead of dumping everything into `secret` or `other`.

| Category | Rules | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Third-party SaaS** | 596 | Various `xxx secret`, service-specific tokens, webhooks, client credentials |
| **Secrets / Keys** | 67 | Generic `client_secret`, `app_secret`, `session_secret` |
| **Development & Delivery** | 40 | GitHub, GitLab, NPM, PyPI, Jenkins, Terraform, JFrog |
| **Cloud Platforms** | 35 | AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud, Huawei Cloud, Azure, Cloudflare |
| **Payments & E-commerce** | 35 | Stripe, PayPal, Square, Razorpay, WeChat Pay, Shopify |
| **Notification & Collaboration** | 31 | Slack, Discord, Telegram, DingTalk, Feishu, Teams, Twilio |
| **Monitoring & Alerting** | 24 | Datadog, New Relic, Sentry, Grafana, PagerDuty |
| **Tokens** | 16 | JWT, Bearer, OAuth tokens, session tokens |
| **Databases & Connections** | 15 | MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, ES, InfluxDB |
| **Passwords** | 13 | Generic passwords, root/admin passwords, DB/protocol passwords |
| **Security Platforms** | 13 | Auth0, Shodan, Censys, VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB |
| **Private Keys & Certificates** | 11 | RSA, DSA, EC, OpenSSH, PKCS8 private keys and certificates |
| **Encoding & Fingerprints** | 8 | Hashes, UUIDs, long Base64 strings, SSH public keys |
| **Contact Information** | 3 | Phone numbers, email addresses, identity numbers |
| **Network Identifiers** | 3 | IPv4, private IPs, MAC addresses |
| **API Keys** | 3 | Generic API key / access key |
| **WeChat Ecosystem** | 3 | AppID, CorpID, Secret |
| **URL / API** | 2 | URLs, API endpoints |
| **Paths** | 1 | File paths, system paths |
| **Domains** | 1 | Domain names with TLD validation |

### False-positive Control Strategy

To keep the 920-rule ruleset usable, the scanner applies several filtering layers by default:

- **Blacklist filtering** - skips common static resource names, framework API fragments, and obviously non-sensitive content
- **Context filtering** - continues to enforce TLD validation, JS API context checks, and path-length checks
- **Placeholder filtering** - excludes examples like `your_api_key`, `replace_me`, `changeme`, and `placeholder`
- **Masked-value filtering** - excludes masked text such as `xxxxxx`, `******`, and `<token>`
- **Weak-value filtering** - adds minimum length, character-shape, and common-word checks for credential-like matches

### Scan and Export Behavior

- `-sensitive=true` generates `sensitive_report.xlsx` and `sensitive_report.html`
- `-postman=true` generates `api_collection.postman_collection.json`
- `-postman` is independent from `-sensitive`
- `scan-only` reuses the same scanner and JS deobfuscation pipeline
- If the HTTP method cannot be inferred reliably, Postman exports `UNKNOWN`
- Relative API paths remain unchanged and are not prefixed with any `baseUrl`

## 🧭 Page and Route Map

After unpacking, the output directory also includes:

- `route_manifest.json`: machine-readable page and route structure
- `route_map.md`: human-readable route description
- `route_map.mmd`: Mermaid graph for navigation rendering

Current route recovery covers:

- Entry-page detection
- Main-package and subpackage page lists
- TabBar pages
- Page titles and file mapping
- `usingComponents` dependencies
- `wx.navigateTo`, `redirectTo`, `reLaunch`, and `switchTab`
- Static WXML `<navigator>` navigation
- WXML `bindtap` / `catchtap` trigger-to-handler mapping
- `data-url`, `data-route`, `data-path`, and `data-page` backfilling
- Dynamic route hints from template strings, string concatenation, and `dataset.url`
- Trigger text, trigger event, and handler name association
- Direct API attribution from page scripts
- Indirect API attribution from shared service modules
- Cross-file call-chain recovery from page handler to local helper to shared helper to final navigation
- Shared router helper inventory for files such as `utils/router.js` and `common/nav.js`
- Orphan-page candidates where `Page(...)` exists but the page is missing from `app.json`

### Report Content

Generated Excel / HTML reports include:

- **Overview** - scan stats, risk distribution, and category summary
- **Category sheets** - built dynamically from actual matches, such as cloud, payment, collaboration, development, and SaaS
- **URL / API** - URL, API endpoint, and request context
- **Databases & Connections** - JDBC, MongoDB, Redis, ES, and other connection information
- **Password / Secret / Token** - passwords, generic secrets, and session or access tokens
- **WeChat Ecosystem** - WeChat-related configuration
- **Obfuscated Files** - file path, score, techniques, and restore state

Each finding includes:
- Content
- Occurrence count
- File path
- Line number
- Risk level

Obfuscated-file entries additionally include:
- Status (`restored` / `partial` / `flagged`)
- Score
- Techniques
- Tag (`[OBFUSCATED] ...`)

### Postman Collection Example

```json
{
  "info": {
    "name": "wx1234567890abcdef - API Collection"
  },
  "item": [
    {
      "name": "POST /api/user/login",
      "request": {
        "method": "POST",
        "url": {
          "raw": "/api/user/login"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Rule Configuration

- The built-in ruleset is used by default
- The program does not auto-write `config/rule.yaml`
- If you manually place `config/rule.yaml`, your custom rules override the built-in rules
- This is suitable when you want to adjust audit scope without modifying source code

## ❓ FAQ

### 1. Why does it “flash close” when double-clicked?
This is a command-line tool and should not be launched by double-clicking the executable.

- Wrong: double-clicking `gwxapkg.exe`
- Correct: open a terminal, `cd` into the tool directory, and run it from there

### 2. Why can’t it find my Mini Program package?
Make sure you have logged into desktop WeChat and opened the target Mini Program at least once. If it still cannot be found, run `scan` and verify whether the detected cache path is correct.

---

## 📩 Contact

If you add on WeChat, please include the reason. Basic questions such as how to open a terminal or install Go will not be answered.
